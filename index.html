                    <p class="card-text">Currently enrolled in Coding Bootcamp and looking to become a Fullstack Developer in the near future. I have Diplomas in both Electrical Engineering and Fitness & Health Promotions. In the past I have mostly wored in trades positions such as a Powerline Technician and Steam Fitter. However at the sametime, worked partime as a Firefighter and Head Coach of a CrossFit gym. I am looking for this career change because from a young age, I have loved being creative. I believe as a WED Developeer, I can bring my wide range of expertise to the industry and apply them to clients that are in need of someone that has knowledge of their industries.</p>
