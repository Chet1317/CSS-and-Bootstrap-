                    <p class="card-text">Father and CrossFit athlete with a passion for being creative. I have always been passionate about athletics. Currently, that passion has taken me to CrossFit. I train between 3 to 4 hours a day, 5 days a week, to compete in local and distant competitions. But, before CrossFit, my sports were mainly Hockey and Baseball. I am looking to get into web development because I enjoy being creative and hope to turn that part of me into a career.</p>
